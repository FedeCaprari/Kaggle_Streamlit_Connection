## How to use

1. Open a Kaggle Dataset page
2. Copy the URI, which has the user name and the data set name seperated with a `/`
3. Paste it in the input box present and check if the project directory is loaded from Kaggle
4. Once the List is loaded, copy any of the file name and paste it in the second input box
5. Click Load data to see the first 20 rows of the data

## Limitation

1. Can read and display only `.csv`, `.json` and `.xlsx`.
2. It has a general read on the data. So if the uploaded dataset has any error, like trailing errors, then this code does not work as expected? or is it working as expected?? I'm not really sure where I am going with this now... 🍺

Anyhow... Thankyou for the opportunity and Happy Streamliting 🎈
